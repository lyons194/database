# database

A workable, user-friendly database.

Using this program, the user can enter, store and analyze data.  In the program's current draft, the user can utilize a handful of commands.  Such commands allows the user to complete actions such as entering data into a semi-permanent memory (deleted once the .py file quits running), querying the database's internal knowledge base for help with the program's commands, setting the program to a 'rest' mode, and quitting the program.

My goal for this project is to create an interactive, user-friendly database program that somewhat mimics the command prompt.  This program will have a multitude of commands (and related features) that will allow the user to have a large degree of flexibility for any data-oriented operations they might undertake.

The database program is still being developed.  Future drafts will include more complex commands, such as allowing the user to analyze their data on a deeper level, and allowing the user to print/retrieve any data/dataset they enter into the program.
