#A running list of all of the command words for the database.

"""
The database will have a list of commands that the user can use in order to access all of the functions of the program.

"""

1 - rest
-"Rest" puts the program on hold.  The user can reactivate the database by pressing the Enter key.  This is the equivalent of sleep mode for the program.


2 - dir
-"Dir" displays the current directory of all the data stored in the database.


3 - add
-"Add" allows the user to add more data to the database.  This command begins by asking the user how many pieces of data they would like to add to the database.  Based upon the number in the user's answer, the program will create a list of that many blank spots, and then will fill those spots with subsequent data points that are entered by the user.
