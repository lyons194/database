#A running list of all of the command words for the database.


"""
The database will have a list of commands that the user can use in order to access all of the functions of the program.

"""


1 - rest
-The "rest" command puts the program on hold.  The user can reactivate the database by pressing the Enter key.  This is the equivalent of sleep mode for the program.


2 - view
-The "view" command displays the current directory of all the data stored in the database.


3 - add
-The "add" command allows the user to add more data to the database.  This command begins by asking the user how many pieces of data they would like to add to the database.  Based upon the number in the user's answer, the program will create a list of that many blank spots, and then will fill those spots with subsequent data points that are entered by the user.


4 - help
-The "help" command allows the user to query the database's help menu, which provides information on each function within the database.


5 - quit
-The "quit" command allows the user to exit the database and return to the Python shell.


6 - clear
-The "clear" command allows the user to delete all of the data entered into the database's memory.


7 - view integer
-The "view integer" command allows the user to view all of the integer-type data that they have entered into the database.


8 - view string
-The "view string" command allows the user to view all of the string-type data that they have entered into the database.


9 - view boolean
-The "view boolean" command allows the user to view all of the boolean-type data they have entered into the database.
